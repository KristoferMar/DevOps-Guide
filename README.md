# DevOps-Guide
Holds information about various DevOps technologies

<h1>DevOps</h1>
- Continous integration (CI) is the practice, in software engineering, of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline servel times a day.
- Continous delivery (CD) is a software engineering approach in witch teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that software can be reliably released at any time.
- In Practice: verify and publish work by triggering automated builds & tests.
- For every commit or at least once a day

<h1>Jenkins</h1>
Detailed jenkins

- All developers should push their changes to a version control, which should then be built and tested - which can be done by jenkins.
- Jenkins doesn't merge code nor it resolves code conflicts, that's still for the developer to do (using for instance got and merge tools)
